# IoT & Embedded Systems 🌱

Guides and projects for microcontrollers, sensors, and connectivity.

## Beginner
- Arduino official docs and starter kits.
- MicroPython for embedded Python on small boards.

## Platforms
- ESP32 / ESP8266 (WiFi microcontrollers)
- Raspberry Pi (single-board computer)

## Projects
- Sensor reading → MQTT pipeline to a broker.
- Simple home automation sensor with OTA updates.

## Tooling
- PlatformIO for cross-platform embedded development.
- Serial logging and power management tips.

## Contributing
- Add reproducible projects with wiring diagrams and safety notes. Prefer small code examples and clear BOM (bill of materials).
