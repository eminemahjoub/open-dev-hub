# AI & Machine Learning 🤖

Welcome to the AI & Machine Learning collection — a curated set of resources, tutorials, datasets, and open-source projects to help you learn and build.

## Overview

This folder aims to collect high-quality learning resources across three levels, plus project ideas and deployment guides.

## Getting started (Beginner)

- Official Python, NumPy and pandas docs — learn data manipulation.
- fast.ai Practical Deep Learning for Coders — hands-on course (https://course.fast.ai/).
- Google’s Machine Learning Crash Course — quick intro with exercises (https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course).
- scikit-learn tutorials — classical ML algorithms and pipelines (https://scikit-learn.org/).

## Intermediate

- TensorFlow 2 and Keras guides — model building and training (https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials).
- PyTorch tutorials and examples — research-first framework (https://pytorch.org/tutorials/).
- Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow (book) — practical companion.

## Advanced

- Papers with Code — track SOTA papers + code (https://paperswithcode.com/).
- Hugging Face Transformers — large language models and fine-tuning (https://huggingface.co/).
- ML Production: model monitoring, serving (SeldonCore, BentoML).

## Datasets & Benchmarks

- Kaggle Datasets — wide range of datasets and competitions (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets).
- UCI Machine Learning Repository — classic datasets (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php).
- OpenImages, COCO — for vision projects.

## Project ideas

- Image classifier with transfer learning (PyTorch/TensorFlow).
- Sentiment analysis service using Hugging Face inference API.
- Deploy a model as a REST API with FastAPI + Docker + CI.

## Open-source projects worth exploring

- scikit-learn — classic ML library
- TensorFlow & PyTorch — primary deep learning frameworks
- Hugging Face Transformers — LLMs and NLP tools

## How to contribute

- Add tutorials, course links or project templates as markdown files.
- Submit small example notebooks demonstrating a specific technique.
