# Contributing to open-dev-hub

Thanks for your interest! This repository is a community-curated hub: small contributions (one link + short annotation) and large additions (starter projects, full tutorials) are all welcome.

## How to contribute
1. Fork the repo.
2. Create a branch: `category/short-description` (e.g., `web/add-react-starter`).
3. Add or update a README in the relevant category folder and include:
   - A one-line summary,
   - A short annotation (1–3 sentences) explaining why the resource is useful,
   - A link to the project or tutorial.
4. Run a quick spell-check and preview the Markdown.
5. Open a Pull Request with a clear description.

## Content guidelines
- Prefer high-quality sources: official docs, well-maintained OSS repos, reputable tutorials.
- Add short annotations explaining value and prerequisites.
- Avoid link-only PRs — add a short guide or sample when possible.

## Adding a starter project
If you add a starter/template:
- Include a `README.md` with quick start, dependency list, and license.
- Keep the code minimal and well-documented.
- Use permissive licenses or clarify attribution.

## Review process
- Contributors and maintainers review PRs for accuracy, clarity, and quality.
- Maintainers may request changes before merging.

Thanks for making this resource better!
