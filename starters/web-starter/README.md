# Web Starter — React + FastAPI (minimal)

A minimal blueprint to start a modern full-stack app.

## Features
- React frontend (Vite) + FastAPI backend
- Docker + docker-compose setup
- Basic CI (lint + tests)

## Quick start (local)
1. Clone repo
2. `cd starters/web-starter`
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure
4. `docker-compose up --build`

## Notes
- Keep frontend and backend small and focused. Use this as a starting point for projects.
